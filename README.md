WHERE_IS_MY_LECTURE

The project is designed around Jaypee Institute Of Information Technology-128 map, around all three floors highlighting the shortest route to your lecture hall.

A number of lecture halls have been assigned different room numbers as well as codes to them.Hence this website helps them to find all the possible names
of a classroom using the name, known to them.

It uses the concept of Graph data structure to add classrooms and its connections and the djisktra algorithm to find the shortest route.It uses object to store associative array to map room number nodes to the respective name of the rooms.
